# Setting up the OCI container images using scripts

If you have already created the container images in a previous Kubernetes lab and not deleted them you can skip this module.

**IMPORTANT** You must have setup a compartment, database and have configured your initials and extracted the user info

##Â Task 1: Downloading the latest scripts

There are a number of scripts that we have created for this lab to make life easier, if you have previously downloaded those recently (in the last few hours) then you can skip this Task and go to task 2. If you downloaded them longer ago then you should ensure you have the latest version, if you haven't downloaded them then you will need to do so.

If you have recently downloaded the scripts then please jump to **Task 2**

If you are not sure if you have downloaded the latest version then you can check

  - In the OCI Cloud shell type 
  
  - `ls $HOME/helidon-kubernetes`

If you get output like this then you need to download the scripts, follow the process in **Task 1a**

```
ls: cannot access /home/tim_graves/helidon-kubernetes: No such file or directory
```

If you get output similar to this (the file names and count may vary slightly as the lab evolves) then you have downloaded the scripts previously, but you should get the latest versions, please follow the steps in **Task 1b**

```
base-kubernetes          configurations       deploy.sh   monitoring-kubernetes  README.md     servicesClusterIP.yaml  stockmanager-deployment.yaml  undeploy.sh
cloud-native-kubernetes  create-test-data.sh  management  README                 service-mesh  setup                   storefront-deployment.yaml    zipkin-deployment.yaml
```

### Task 1a: Downloading the scripts

We will use git to download the scripts

  1. Open the OCI Cloud Shell

  2. Make sure you are in the top level directory
  
  - `cd $HOME`
  
  3. Clone the repository with all scripts from github into your OCI Cloud Shell environment
  
  - `git clone https://github.com/CloudTestDrive/helidon-kubernetes.git`
  
  ```
  Cloning into 'helidon-kubernetes'...

Resolving deltas: 100% (423/423), done.
```

Note that the precise details will vary as the lab is updated over time.

Please go to **Task 2** Do not continue with anything else in task 1

### Task 1b: Updating the scripts

We will use git to update the scripts

  1. Open the OCI Cloud shell type
  
  2. Make sure you are in the home directory
  
  - `cd $HOME/helidon-kubernetes`
  
  3. Use git to get the latest updates
  
  - `git pull`

```

Note that the output will vary depending on exactly what changes have been made since you first download the scripts or last updated them.

Please continue with **Task 2**

## Task 2: Creating the container images

Due to legal restrictions we can no longer provide pre-built container images, we can however provide scripts and source code to let you build your own images (No, I don't understand that either)

To do this we need to obtain an authentication token (needed to push the images to a OCIR repo) to create the OCIR repos and then build and push the images to the OCIR repos.

We have provided a script that will do all of this.

<details><summary><b>What does this script actually do ?</b></summary>  

The script is a wrapper around several other scripts that create and configure resources that will be deployed into Kubernetes.

The information gathered and the OCID's of the resource created are stored in the `$HOME/hk8sLabsSettings` file for reuse by other scripts and also to identify resources that have already been created so they can be reused.

To start with it will create an auth token that can be used to log into the OCIR to upload the images. If you have existing tokens you can re-use them as long as you know their value. The script will also offer to  save the value of the token away so you can reuse it later without having to re-enter it. For a free tier trial this is OK as it;s saved within your cloud shell home directory so is only accessible by you, but in a commercial environment you should take note of the generated token and re-enter when prompted.

After this it will determine the details needed to create the OCIR URL used to upload images in a docker push command. It then updates the image location in the Kubernetes deployments and the docker build scripts with this location.

Next it will create the OCIR image repos in your compartment. This is done because the docker v2 registry API does not understand about specific containers, so by default they would be created in the root of the tenancy if you do not precreate them in a specific compartment,this makes running the labs a lot easier if people are charing a tenancy and using different compartments.

The last step is to build and upload the container images to the OCIR using the location found earlier. This process is multi step in it's own right and includes downloading the appropriate JDK and the source code of the microservices. It then runs the build scripts in the downloaded microservices, these use Maven to run the build process, JIB to create the images (though there is a little after the event manipulation). Do allow for different versions it then does the same build and push process with t different version.

The build process using maven can take a long time as the first time it's run Maven needs to download a **lot** of jar files, however once they have been downloaded once they can be reused by the subsequent builds.

**If your Kubernetes cluster creation script is still running** you do not need to wait for it to complete, simply open another window onto the OCI console then open a cloud shell in it (The precise mechanism is browser specific, but often Shift clicking on the [Oracle Cloud logo](images/oracle-cloud-logo.png) on the upper left will open a new window, then just open a new cloud shell) 

  1. If you are not already there open the OCI cloud shell and go to the scripts directory, type
  
  - `cd $HOME/helidon-kubernetes/setup/common`
  
  2. Run the script, in the OCI Cloud Shell type
  
  - `bash ./image-environment-setup.sh`
  
  ```
  Getting region environment details
This script will run the required commands to setup your own images
It assumes you are working in a free trial environment
If you are not you will need to exit at the prompt and follow the lab instructions for setting up the configuration separatly
Are you running in a free trial environment (y/n) ? 
```

  3. If you are in a free trial environment enter `y` If you are not the script will check if it can continue, and if not it will provide you with instructions. The text below is assuming it is able to proceed
  
  ```
  Thank you for confirming you are in a free trial, let's set your container image environment up
Loading existing settings information
No existing auth token.
No existing auth token OCID.
Checking region
You are in your home region and this script will continue
No existing auth tokens, will create a new one
Creating a new auth token for you
Your new auth token is oyUA9FOAtL):94Lt<+LW It is critical that you do not lose this information so please take note of it.
if needed you can delete the token by running the auth-token-destroy.sh script and then create a new one, but you will have
to repeat all of the processes that use it if you do.
Do you want to save the auth token value to make later reuse easier ?
This will make doing the lab easier as otherwise you will have to re-enter it when its needed, but 
it is not good security practice, the token will not be accessible unless logged in as
you so its not a major risk, but you should not do this if you are using this tenancy for
anything other than lab work
Save the auth token ?
```

  4. The script will create a auth token for you automatically if you don't have one, if you do it will let you chose between creating a new one (if possible) or selecting an existing one. In the example above it created a new one.
  
  5. You are asked if you want to save the auth token, If you are running in a free trial account I would recommend doing so by entering `y` at the prompt, however in a non trial tenancy you should not save it. **IMPORTANT** this is the only time you will see the value of the auth token, unless you chose to save it you **MUST** be sure to save the value somewhere save as you will need to provide it later on, and you cannot get this value again later.
  
  In this case I chose to save it.
  
  ```
  Your new auth token is has been saved in the /home/tim_graves/hk8sLabsSettings file its a good idea for you to
still take note of it as you may want it for other situations.
Loading existing settings information
Determining settings
Do you want to use tg_labs_base_repo as the base for naming your repo ? 
```
  
  6. The script will now setup some OCIR repositories to hold the base container images. by default it will use `<your-initials>_labs_base_repo` as the start of the name (it will create two repos under that called `stockmanager` and `storefront`) you will need to confirm if you are OK with this by entering `y` if not you can enter a new repo base name
  
  ```
  OK, going to use tg_labs_base_repo as the container image repo name
Using the saved auth token for the docker login

```

  7. Once the OCI repos have been configured the script will then download the source code and Java, build the images, push them to the OCIR repos it's just created and update template deployment files with ones containing the image location. This will take about 5 mins and there will be lot's of outout.
